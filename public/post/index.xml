      <description>This week the data was inspired from the Dignity &amp;amp; Debt project. This will help in understanding and spreading awareness around Student Loan debt. The data source is here
The objective for this is to perform data visualization and determine the most preferred method of payment for student loans in the US. I will use patchwork package to combine plots.
Loading the data

      <title>R markdown errors - not knitting</title>
      <link>/post/error_rprofile/</link>

      <description>I was getting errors knitting .Rmarkdown or .Rmd files and the culprint was that I had multiple .Rprofiles in my Home and project directories. The error is as shown below
Everytime I restarted the machine it was loading the previous workspace with the following error.
At first I thought .RData was the culprint and I unliked it using unlink(&amp;ldquo;~/.RData&amp;rdquo;). It still did not solve the problem.
I had updated to the latest Rversion and my first instinct was update libraries, uninstall and reinstall R+Rstudio but still the error was there anytime I tried knitting.</description>
