      <description>I was getting errors knitting .Rmarkdown or .Rmd files and the culprint was that I had multiple .Rprofiles in my Home and project directories. The error is as shown below
Everytime I restarted the machine it was loading the previous workspace with the following error.
At first I thought .RData was the culprint and I unliked it using unlink(&amp;ldquo;~/.RData&amp;rdquo;). It still did not solve the problem.
I had updated to the latest Rversion and my first instinct was update libraries, uninstall and reinstall R+Rstudio but still the error was there anytime I tried knitting.</description>
