<blockquote>
<p>The objective is to provide insights based on the information from the New Zealand (NZ) Ministry of Health. Here is the <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-current-cases/covid-19-current-cases-details">link</a> for obtaining the COVID-19 cases. Will look at the exploring the confirmed cases per District Health Board - commonly known as DHB, gender and age group.</p>

<p><em>With time I might automate the data visualisation - the tricky bit is that the table format and HTML texts/labels keep changing every time. This caused errors in my previous automated visualisation making it difficult to automate data extraction/mining.</em></p>

<h2>Data Mining and Cleaning</h2>
<p>I used <code>rvest</code> and <code>xml2</code> packages for data mining, <code>tidyverse</code> for data exploration and visualization. The codes can be viewed here.</p>
<p>We have 552 confirmed cases as at 9.00 am 30 March. Below is a glimpse of the confirmed cases - the table only has variables of interest</p>

<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
<p>From the above chart, we observe that Auckland, Southern, Waikato and Waitemata are the top four DHBs which constitutes 41.12 % of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in NZ.</p>
<p>When analysing individual variables, I noticed some missing information on gender, age group were missing. We shall exclude these</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#summary 1 by age and gender
confirmed.cases.by &lt;- confirmed.cases %&gt;% 
  group_by(`Age Group`, Sex) %&gt;%

  arrange(`Age Group`) %&gt;% 
  mutate( prop=n*100/tot) %&gt;% 
  filter(! `Age Group`== &quot;&quot; &amp; !Sex ==&quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Removing them reduced the data set by about 1 percent</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#visualization 1

  mutate(count= if_else(Sex==&quot;Female&quot;, -n, n)) %&gt;%

  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-60, 60, 20),
                     labels = c(seq(60,0,-20), seq(20,60,20)))+

<p>The age group with the highest confirmed cases is 20 to 29 which is 25.54% of the total confirmed cases, followed by 40 to 49 with 16.12 % and then 50 to 59 with 16.12%. We have more female confirmed cases.</p>

<p>Almost a similar chart as above, this however includes time. The size of the doot indicates the number od confirmed cases recorded. Initially the confirmed cases were from people &gt; 30 years and over time the cases were recorded for people &lt; 20 years including one &lt;1 year and four who are in the 1-4 age group.</p>
<p>Creating a wordcloud of the Last country before New Zealand. Some of the confirmed cases have New Zealand as the last country to imply within-country travel and this is based on the flight Nos. Hover to get the count for each country.</p>
