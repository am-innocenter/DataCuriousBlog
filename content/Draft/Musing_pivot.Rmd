```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

I was using pivot_wider and noticed some values were NA for some column and this was not supposed to be the case. I will share a replicated example and what steps I used 

```{r}
Variable <- LETTERS[1:5]
Value <- rep(10:29)
Year <- rep(2010:2014)
df <- data.frame(c(Year, Year, Year, Year), c(Variable,Variable, Variable, Variable), Value)
colnames(df) <- c("Year", "Variable", "Value")
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Variable, values_from = Value, values_fn = list(Value=mean)) ->df1
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Year, Variable) %>% 
   pivot_wider(names_from = Variable, values_from = Value, values_fn = list(Value=mean))
```
